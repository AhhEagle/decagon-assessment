# Engineering Problems

This repo contains solution to the decagon decaRide problem.

## Run Project
To run the project, clone the project by using `git clone `

You can run either `yarn` or `npm install`

To run tests, run

`yarn jest --watch`

Or if you use npm

`npm test -- --watch`


You can elide the `--watch` flag to just run tests

All tests should pass.

The solution to question 3 can be found in  `src/analysis.js`
The solution to question 4 can be found in `src/report.js`

--- 
Do not delete the `node_modules` folder in the `src` folder, it is a hack to get the `api` files to be absolute.

You need the `api` module for Question 3-4.
See documentation for the `api` module at [api.md](./api.md)
