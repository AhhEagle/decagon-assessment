The solution to question 3 can be found in  `src/analysis.js`
The solution to question 4 can be found in `src/report.js`

--- 
Do not delete the `node_modules` folder in the `src` folder, it is a hack to get the `api` files to be absolute.

You need the `api` module for Question 3-4.
See documentation for the `api` module at [api.md](./api.md)
